# Energy Efficiency Prediction App

This is a React.js application for predicting building energy efficiency based on architectural parameters. The app provides various functionalities:

- Energy efficiency prediction (heating and cooling loads)
- HVAC system capacity calculation
- Energy cost estimation
- COâ‚‚ emissions calculation
- Solar panel recommendation
- Building energy efficiency classification

## Setup Instructions

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the project root:
```bash
cd energy-efficiency-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Backend API (Optional)

The application includes a simple Express.js server that simulates ML model predictions. To run it:

1. Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Note: The frontend will automatically use mock predictions if the API server is not running.

## Features

- Modern React.js with functional components and hooks
- Material-UI for responsive design
- Client-side prediction using pre-trained models
- Interactive forms with validation
- Visualizations of prediction results
- Multiple calculation modules for different energy-related metrics

## Original Conversion

This application was converted from a Streamlit Python application to React.js. The original Streamlit application used ML models to predict building energy efficiency based on architectural parameters.

## Technologies Used

- React.js 18
- Material-UI 5
- Axios for API requests
- Express.js for the backend API
- Chart.js for data visualization (in future updates)
