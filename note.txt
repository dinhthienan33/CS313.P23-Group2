Whether you are trying to reduce the cost of your energy bill or you're trying to reduce your carbon footprint, improving the energy efficacy of your building can both save you some money and even help the environment. We will be looking at a data set that can help us with both!


As a knowledgeable professional in the HVAC industry, it’s crucial to provide accurate advice to designers, not only to improve your own credibility but also to enhance their projects and potentially secure more orders. To facilitate this process, we have compiled a set of rules of thumb that can be applied to most general applications. However, it’s imperative to emphasise that while we are well-versed in HVAC principles, we are not designers, and our advice should always be verified by others before installation. This disclaimer must be clearly stated in all written communications if our equipment design is based on these rules of thumb.
